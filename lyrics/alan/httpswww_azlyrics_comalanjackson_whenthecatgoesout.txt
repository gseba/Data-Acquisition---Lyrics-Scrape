Alan Jackson - When The Cat Goes Out Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

I'll do anything I can
To keep our love together one more time
Sorry I deceived you
But you made it hard for me to stay in line
Loving you came easy
But for reasons I'll explain I drift away
When the sun goes down and the cat goes out
The mice will play
Last week you went to Vegas with your friends
And left me here alone
I didn't mind you leaving
But it hurts when you don't call me when you're gone
See my mind begins to wander
And I'll find someone to take the hurt away
When the sun goes down and the cat goes out
The mice will play
Loving you came easy
But for reasons I've explained I drift away
When the sun goes down and the cat goes out
The mice will play
