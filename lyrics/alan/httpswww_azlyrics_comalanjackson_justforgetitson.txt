Alan Jackson - Just Forget It, Son Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

So now it's over, and you're free
You've left your little boy and me
You say you're tired of staying home
And you can make it on your own
I thought this family was your life
You're a new woman, not a wife
And now you're chasin' a new dream
Found in a Cosmo magazine
That little guy and I will find our way
We never really knew you anyway
And when he wants to know the when the where the why and how
The mama who should be at home is gone
I'll tell him just forget it son
I spent a lifetime lovin' you
Or was it just a year or two
The girl I thought had clipped her wings
Lived only in my boyish dreams
Someday they'll say your son looks just like you
But you'll never know if what they say is true
And when he wants to know the when the where the why and how
The mama who should be at home is gone
I'll tell him just forget it son
And when he wants to know the when the where the why and how
The mama who should be at home is gone
I'll tell him just forget it son
It's just the times, not what we've done
