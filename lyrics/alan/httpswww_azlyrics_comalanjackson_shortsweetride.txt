Alan Jackson - Short Sweet Ride Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

I could see it coming from a mile away,
A heartache looking for a place to stay.
But I couldn't resist her and I couldn't be cool,
The Lord made a woman to make a man a fool.
[Chorus:]
It's an age old story but it still holds true,
There ain't no ending to what a man won't do.
He'll loves some woman till he goes insane,
It's a short sweet ride on a runaway train.
I was drunk and crazy by her sweet perfume,
But I knew stone sober I was being used.
Now, the heartache lingers like a cheap cologne,
She took all she wanted and she was gone.
[Chorus:]
Well, It's an age old story but it still holds true,
There ain't no ending to what a man won't do.
He'll loves some woman till he goes insane,
It's a short sweet ride on a runaway train.
It was almost worth it for the time we spent,
'Cause there ain't no future in a heart for rent.
Still she taught me something 'bout the facts of life,
That love cuts quicker than a switch- blade knife.
[Chorus:]
It's an age old story but it still holds true,
There ain't no ending to what a man won't do.
He'll loves some woman till he goes insane,
It's a short sweet ride on a runaway train.
[Chorus:]
It's an age old story but it still holds true,
There ain't no ending to what a man won't do.
He'll loves some woman till he goes insane,
It's a short sweet ride on a runaway train.
A short sweet ride on a runaway train...
