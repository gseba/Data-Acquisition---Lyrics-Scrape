Alan Jackson - Merle And George Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Daddy had a 1969 Ford
And I was just 'bout ten years old
We would listen to Jones and Haggard on the radio
He sang these things I still care
To a girl he used to know
Ol' Jones and Haggard raised my country soul
I learned how to sing and shuffle my shoes
Listenin' to the Hag sing the "Workin' Man Blues"
I never met ol' Merle, but we were awful close
I cut my teeth on "Swinging Doors"
And "And Momma Tried To Sing Me Home"
Ol' Jones and Haggard raised my country soul
I may be ragged but I'm right
I've got five dollars and it's Saturday night
Ol' George sure put a lot of heart in the songs he sang
And every time daddy got a little bit tired
"Walk Through This World" would make him proud
Ol' Jones and Haggard raised my country soul
I learned how to sing and shuffle my shoes
Listenin' to Hank sing "The Workin Mam Blues"
I never met ol' Merle but we was awful close
I cut my teeth on "Swinging Doors"
And "And Momma Tried To Sing Me Home"
Ol' Jones and Haggard raised my country soul
Ol' George and Merle they raised my country soul
