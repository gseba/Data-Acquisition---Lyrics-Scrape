Alan Jackson - I Couldn't Care More Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Lately, it seems that
The love that you once had in your eyes
Is now all but gone
'Cause when I reach to hold you
Your always so cold to me
Darlin' what have I done wrong
We're falling apart right in front of my eyes
And it's something I just can't ignore
Well baby, maybe, you couldn't care less
But darlin', I couldn't care more
Maybe, there been times
I hurt you and for that I'm so sorry
What else can I say
Do help us, get back to
The love that we once knew
Oh darlin' don't throw us away
We're falling apart right in front of my eyes
And it's something I just can't ignore
Well baby, maybe, you couldn't care less
But darlin', I couldn't care more
Yeah, baby, maybe you couldn't care less
Oh, but darlin' I couldn't care more
