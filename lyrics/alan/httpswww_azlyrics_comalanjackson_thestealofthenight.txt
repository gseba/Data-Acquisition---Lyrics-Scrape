Alan Jackson - The Steal Of The Night Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Well you'd never know it by looking at them
That she was the woman that walked in with him
He danced every dance while she watched from her chair
And he carried on like she wasn't there
Well she was a beauty and I thought to myself
What a fool he must be to want someone else
Well I watched and I waited till the time was just right
And I walked away with the steal of the night
Like a thief I slipped in
To take what I could
Now I should feel guilty
But I just feel good
And while he two-timed and he two-stepped we slipped out of sight
And I walked away with the steal of the night
Like a thief I slipped in
To take what I could
Now I should feel guilty
But I just feel good
And while he two-timed and he two-stepped we slipped out of sight
And I walked away with the steal of the night
Yeah, I walked away with the steal of the night
