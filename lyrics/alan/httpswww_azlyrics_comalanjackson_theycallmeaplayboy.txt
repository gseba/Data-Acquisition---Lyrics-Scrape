Alan Jackson - They Call Me A Playboy Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

They call me a playboy
As I'm making my rounds
Chasing the bright light
Of each night spot in town
Though I never show it
My heart's breaking in two
They may call me a playboy
But I'm just lonesome for you
I once had a real love
That was when I had you
Now I'll never feel love
With somebody new
This false front I'm wearing
Is just to cover my blues
They may call me a playboy
But I'm just lonesome for you
I once had a real love
That was when I had you
Now I'll never feel love
With somebody new
This false front I'm wearing
Is just to cover my blues
They may call me a playboy
But I'm just lonesome for you
They may call me a playboy
But I'm just lonesome for you
