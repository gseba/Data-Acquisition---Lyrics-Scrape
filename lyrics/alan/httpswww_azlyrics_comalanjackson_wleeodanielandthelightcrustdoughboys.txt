Alan Jackson - W. Lee O'Daniel And The Light Crust Dough Boys Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

As we listened to the Opera when I was just a kid
My daddy talked through Saturday's them crazy things he did
He said this is a story, how your Mamma first met me
And the going thing was Texas swing before Bob Will's was king
Was in the town of Tulsa about 30 years ago
At Cain's Academy down in old Oklahoma
Well the dust was blowing but the music was right
And W Lee O'Daniel played it all night
For The Light Crust Dough Boys and W. Lee O'Dan
We drove 80 miles through that blowing sand
My '37 Chevy was shootin' steam
Coming up them hill it just seized up on me
And I wouldn't miss a dance on Saturday night
We're all in the chevy's in that Detroit light
I can hear that music in my ears
I was ready to go and I was shifting them gears
So your mamma passed the biscuits and gave me her hand
Knew she was my honey and she knew I was her man
We listened to the fiddler he was making it sing
And heard them pretty notes of that guitar ring
I had no trouble, was feeling no pain
That moon shine whiskey and your mamma in my van
And The Light Crust Dough Boys and old Pappy Dan
Played us a song, we'll never forget
At the time they were tough and money was tight
But I didn't care on Saturday night
Had no money but I couldn't sing the blues
I felt like dancin' down in my shoes
Was in the town of Tulsa by 30 years ago
At Cain's Academy down in the old Oklahoma
When the dust was blowing but music was right
And W Lee o'Daniel played it all night
Yeah W Lee o'Daniel he played it all night
