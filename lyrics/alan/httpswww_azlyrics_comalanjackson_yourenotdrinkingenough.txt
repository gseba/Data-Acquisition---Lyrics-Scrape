Alan Jackson - You're Not Drinking Enough Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

I can see that you haven't recovered
From the girl who let you down
You would sell what is left of your soul
For another go 'round
You keep telling yourself she means nothing
Maybe you should call her bluff
But if you don't really mean it
You must not be drinking enough
Well, the perfume she wore
You can buy down at the five and dime
But on some other woman
It don't smell the same in your mind
You keep telling yourself you can take it
You tell yourself that you're tough
But if you still want to hold her
You must not be drinking enough
You're not drinking enough
To wash away old memories
And there ain't enough whiskey in Texas
To keep you from begging, please, please, please
She passed on your passion, stepped on your pride
It turns out you ain't quite so tough
'Cause you still want to hold her
You must not be drinking enough
You heard this grown man cry
You ask yourself why
'Cause you still want to hold her
You must not be drinking enough
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ask yourself why
You still wanna hold her
You must no be drinking enough
