Alan Jackson - The Angels Cried Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

[Alan:]
They came from near
They came from far
Following a distant star
To where he lay
Not being sure of what it meant
But knowing it was Heaven sent
They made their way
And the creatures gathered 'round
And didn't make a sound
And the Angels cried
[Alison:]
The angels knew what was to come
The reason God has sent His Son from up above
It filled their hearts with joy to see
And knowing of his destiny
Came tears of love
And the creatures gathered 'round
And didn't make a sound
[Both:]
And the Angels cried
[Alan:]
I've often thought about that night
And wondered if they realized that star so bright
[Alison:]
Was sent to tell all the land the Son of God
Would soon become the son of a man
[Both:]
And the creatures gathered 'round
And didn't make a sound
And the Angels cried
And the Angels cried
And the Angels cried...
