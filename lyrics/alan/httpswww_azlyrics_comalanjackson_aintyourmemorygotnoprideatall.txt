Alan Jackson - Ain't Your Memory Got No Pride At All Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

I woke up with her in my arms this morning
God knows, I love her over all
She whispered she loves me, your memory appeared
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
You were here, we loved, now you're gone
So why can't you let bygones be bygones, and be gone
You always find the wrong times to come around to call
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
So tonight I lay here touching her sweet body
And the good familiar feeling I recall
She whispered she loves me, your memory appeared
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
You were here, we loved, now you're gone
So why can't you let bygones be bygones, and be gone
You always find the wrong times to come around to call
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
Ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
