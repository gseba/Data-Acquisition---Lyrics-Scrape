Queen - Modern Times Rock 'N' Roll Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Had to make do with a worn out rock 'n' roll scene
The old bop is getting tired need a rest
Well you know what I mean
Fifty-eight that was great
But it's over now and that's all
Something harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya grab you hard
Make you feel ten-feet tall
Well I hope that a big new baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temperature down
And the jukebox blowing no fuse
And my musical life's feeling
Like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know that there's one thing
Every single body could use
Yeah, listen to me baby
Let me tell you what it's all about
Modern-times rock 'n' roll
Modern-times rock 'n' roll
Get your high-heeled guitar-style boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest
And a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says
He's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants
Think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world
Just gonna know who you are
Look out
Modern-times rock 'n' roll
