Queen - I'm In Love With My Car Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

The machine of a dream
Such a clean machine
With the pistons a-pumpin'
And the hubcaps all gleam
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
With my hand on your grease gun
It's like a disease son
I'm in love with my car
Gotta feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer rollbar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal
Told my girl I have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburettor
So she made tracks sayin' this is the end now
Cars don't talk back they're just four-wheeled friends now
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When I'm cruisin' in overdrive
Don't have to listen to no run-of-the-mill talk jive
I'm in love with my car
(Ooh, I'm in love with my car)
Gotta feel for my automobile
I'm in love with my car
(Ooh, I'm in love with my car)
String-back gloves in my automolove!
