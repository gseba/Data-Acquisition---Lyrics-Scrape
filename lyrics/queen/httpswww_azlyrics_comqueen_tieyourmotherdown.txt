Queen - Tie Your Mother Down Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beatin', baby
Got my timin' right
Got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight
My little school babe
Your momma says you don't
And your daddy says you won't
And I'm boilin' up inside
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Oh, no
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
"You're such a dirty louse
Go get out of my house"
That's all I ever get from your
Family ties
In fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word
From those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Sniping and grousing going on all night
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Take your little brother swimmin'
With a brick (that's alright)
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine
Bad guy
Your mommy and your daddy gonna
Plague me 'til I die
They can't understand it
I'm just a peace-lovin' guy
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Get that big big big big big big daddy out the door
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight
Give me every inch of your love
All your love tonight, yeah
Gotta get my timing right
All your love
Tonight
