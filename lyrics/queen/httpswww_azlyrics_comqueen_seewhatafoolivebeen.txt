Queen - See What A Fool I've Been Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Well she's gone, dear, gone this morning
I wan' see what a fool I've been
Oh, Lord, guilty, cruel
Morning
Fool I've been
Yes, I did too much
Didn't leave me-me no letter
Didn't leave no warning
You naughty thing, you
Ooh - well, I guess I'm all to blame
Oh, Lord
I guess I'm all to blame
See you later
Say
Ciao
...night
Take it
Oh, my little dog ain't too hungry
No, no, he kept on barking
The vicious thing just don't seem the same
Oh, no, no
Just
Oh, tantrums
Said don't feel the same
Ooh, see you later
Now hit it like that
Coming up strong
Well, I got so lonely
Went and told my neighbor
She said, "Mm mm mm mm mm."
Oh, Lord, what a fool I've been
And then she told what to do
She said, "Go home."
Well, she's gone, gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
Oh, Lord
What a fool I've been
Thank you
