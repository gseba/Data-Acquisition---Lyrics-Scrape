Queen - The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

He's a fairy feller
The fairy folk have gathered round the new moon shine
To see the feller crack a nut at night's noon time
To swing his axe he swears, as it climbs he dares
To deliver
The Master-Stroke
Ploughman, "Waggoner Will", and types
Politician with senatorial pipe - he's a dilly-dally-o
Pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown, dirty fellow
What a dirty laddio
Tatterdemalion and a junketeer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter - he's my hero
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow "can we see the Master-Stroke"
What a quaere fellow
Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch-magician presides
He is the leader
Oberon and Titania watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen and there's a good apothecary-man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a quaere fellow
The ostler stares with hands on his knees
Come on Mr. Feller, crack it open if you please
