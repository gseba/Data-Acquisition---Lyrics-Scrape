Queen - Sweet Lady Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Ooh, I like it
You call me up and treat me like a dog
You call me up and tear me up inside
You've got me on a lead
Ooh, you bring me down
You shout around
You don't believe that I'm alone
Ooh, you don't believe me
Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady (sweet lady)... stay sweet
You say
You call me up and feed me all the lines
You call me sweet like I'm some kind of cheese
Waiting on the shelf
You eat me up
You hold me down
I'm just a fool to make you a home
Ooh, you really do
And you say
Sweet lady
(Sweet lady)
Sweet lady
(Sweet lady)
Sweet lady (ooh, come on)... stay sweet
My sweet lady
Though it seems like we wait forever
Stay sweet, baby
Believe and we've got everything we need
(Got everything we need)
Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady (Yeah, ooh, ooh)... stay sweet
Stay sweet
Runaway come on
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Sweet lady
Woo!
