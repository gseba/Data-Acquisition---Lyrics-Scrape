Queen - Tenement Funster Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

My new purple shoes been amazing the people next door
And my rock-and-roll 45s, been enraging the folks on the lower floor
I got a way with the girls on my block
Try my best be a real individual
And when we go down to Smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kinda ritual
Ooh, give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car, I'll make the speed of light out of this place
I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
And this same situation just cuts like a knife
When you're young, and you're poor, and you're crazy
(Young and you're crazy)
(Young and you're crazy)
(Young and you're crazy)
Young and you're crazy!
Ooh, give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car, I'll make the speed of light out of this place
